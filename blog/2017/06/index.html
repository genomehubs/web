            GenomeHubs is now compatible with <a href="http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2017/05/31/ensembl-89-has-been-released/">
              Ensembl release 89</a> (EnsemblGenomes release 36). This brings GenomeHubs up to date
            with the latest genome database releases and many of the latest Ensembl features.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an independent project, GenomeHubs cannot keep up with the Ensembl release
            schedule, but this upgrade from Ensembl release 85 maintains the currency of the platform
            as we reach the end of our current funding period. Support for Ensembl 89 has been incorporated
            in to the GenomeHubs tools tagged '17.06', with updated documentation available at
            <a href="https://genomehubs.gitbooks.io/genomehubs/content/">genomehubs.gitbooks.io</a>.

          <p>
            The <a href="http://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org">BlobToolKit</a> project has been funded by the BBSRC for 3 years to
            develop the latest iteration of the Blobology/Blobtools genome assembly QC, visualisation
            and filtering tools. The project is a collaboration between the research groups
            of Mark Blaxter at the University of Edinburgh and Guy Cochrane at EMBL-EBI to develop
            software tools and protocols to aid in the separation of cobionts and removal of
            contaminants from genomic datasets prior to genome sequence assembly.
          </p>
          <p>
            BlobToolKit follows on from the development of
            Blobology<sup>1</sup> and BlobTools<sup>2</sup> over
            the past few years in the Blaxter Lab at the University of Edinburgh.
            As development on BlobToolKit has only just begun,
            users interested in applying these approaches should continue to use Dom Laetsch's
            <a href ="https://drl.github.io/blobtools/">BlobTools</a> package directly until
            the methods are fully incorporated into BlobToolKit.

          <p>
            GenomeHubs has been developed as part of the <a href="http://lepbase.org">LepBase</a>
            project, which was funded by the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk">BBSRC</a>
            Bioinfromatics and Biological Resources Fund until 30th June 2017. We are currently
            seeking further funding to allow us to continue to develop GenomeHubs as a
            platform for non-model organism databasing, but from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2017 we will
            no longer be able to maintain full development effort on the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that a GenomeHubs site would be a useful tool for your community then
            please get in touch so we can discuss ways that we can collaborate to bring the power of
            and Ensembl-based platform to your favourite genomes.
