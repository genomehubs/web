title: Introducing BlobToolKit

The [BlobToolKit](http://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org) project has been funded by the BBSRC for 3 years to
develop the latest iteration of the Blobology/Blobtools genome assembly QC, visualisation
and filtering tools. The project is a collaboration between the research groups
of Mark Blaxter at the University of Edinburgh and Guy Cochrane at EMBL-EBI[]() to develop
software tools and protocols to aid in the separation of cobionts and removal of
contaminants from genomic datasets prior to genome sequence assembly.

BlobToolKit follows on from the development of
Blobology<sup>1</sup> and BlobTools<sup>2</sup> over
the past few years in the Blaxter Lab at the University of Edinburgh.
As development on BlobToolKit has only just begun,
users interested in applying these approaches should continue to use Dom Laetsch's
<a href ="https://drl.github.io/blobtools/">BlobTools</a> package directly until
the methods are fully incorporated into BlobToolKit.
