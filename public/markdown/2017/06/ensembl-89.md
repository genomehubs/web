GenomeHubs is now compatible with [Ensembl release 89](http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2017/05/31/ensembl-89-has-been-released/)
 (EnsemblGenomes release 36). This brings GenomeHubs up to date
with the latest genome database releases[]() and many of the latest Ensembl features.

As an independent project, GenomeHubs cannot keep up with the Ensembl release
schedule, but this upgrade from Ensembl release 85 maintains the currency of the platform
as we reach the end of our current funding period. Support for Ensembl 89 has been incorporated
in to the GenomeHubs tools tagged '17.06', with updated documentation available at
[genomehubs.gitbooks.io](https://genomehubs.gitbooks.io/genomehubs/content/).
