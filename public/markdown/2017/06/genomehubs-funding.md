title: GenomeHubs Funding

GenomeHubs has been developed as part of the [LepBase](http://lepbase.org)
project, which was funded by the [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk)
Bioinformatics and Biological Resources Fund[]() until 30<sup>th</sup> June 2017. We are currently
seeking further funding to allow us to continue to develop GenomeHubs as a
platform for non-model organism databasing, but from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2017 we will
no longer be able to maintain full development effort on the project.

If you believe that a GenomeHubs site would be a useful tool for your community then
please get in touch so we can discuss ways that we can collaborate to bring the power of
an Ensembl-based platform to your favourite genomes.
